# Hoppscotch

To use the api-export JSON, you will require Hoppscotch installed, or use it on the browser.

1. Navigate to the collections section of Hoppscotch.
2. Click the "Import / Export" button (folder with a down arrow).
3. Click "Import from Hoppscotch"
4. Choose the api-export file, and select "Import".

This should import all the API routes.

# Postman

This has not been tested on Postman, but it should be similar to the Hoppscotch instructions.
